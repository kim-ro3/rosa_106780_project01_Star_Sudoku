P01_B: Structured with functions

This game is a sudoku, but it is not the traditional sudoku we all know. It is a sudoku star, divided in 6 triangles of different colors where each one must contain the numbers from 1 to 9. The graphics.py library was used to create the game, different functions were created, one of welcome to the game with the instructions, the other functions are of the 6 triangles and each one of them uses functions for the entry objects, function for the text methods and polygon methods. These functions are called within the game function that is responsible for joining all the functions of triangles and finally used if __name__ == '__main__' to present the game.
